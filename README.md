# "Computing Culture"
The contents of this repository is in all likelihood, if we are to be completely honest, not going to be of interest to many.

It contains the code for a CLI app built with a very specific purpose in mind:
To computationally and (semi-)quantitatively approach certain types of textual empirical data in cultural studies; For my own purposes it is to examine, in a reproducible and consistent manner, the support for an hypothesis of mine within the cognitive science of religion (details to follow below at a later time, for whoever might be interested).

Feel free to use the code or the, once finished, "app" in any way you choose ("BSD-3-Clause"), or to contact me if you have questions or comments :-)
